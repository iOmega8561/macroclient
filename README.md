## Current State
The application is not finished but it's half the way done. It will probably never be completed but this code will be available as a showcase.

## Features
1) Custom client API that offers feature parity with MateZ server'API
2) Awesome custom UI design and UX experience, well integrated with iOS style
3) Custom made assets (aside from game icons)
4) Support for local authentication with FaceID and TouchID
5) Custom loading animation
6) Filtering algoritm to help the user find what he wants

## Credits
This application includes assets such as game icons, all credits go respective owners, these assets have not been used for commercial used. Big fat thanks to my team mates Giada Pisani and Laura Bognanni for their awesome UI, UX and custom assets work. Thanks to Aryan Garg for his chat screen contribution.
